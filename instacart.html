				<h2>1. Project Goals</h2>
					<p class="justified"><u>Motivation</u><br /> 
					Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app, wants to uncover more information about their sales patterns,
          with the goal of enhancing them.
          </p> 
					<p class="justified"><u>Objective</u><br /> 
					Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis of some of their data (2017 sales) to derive insights on customers purchasing habits and 
          suggest strategies for better segmentation and targeted marketing.</p>
				<h2>2. Key Questions</h2>
					<p class="justified">
          Many business questions were raised in the beginning of the project, and several others were added during the analysis.
          The following deserve a highlight:
						<ul>
							<li>What are the busiest days of the week and busiest hours of the day?</li>
							<li>Are our customers spending more at certain times of the day/week?</li>
							<li>Are certain types of products more popular than others, both in sales volume and revenue?</li>
							<li>How are our customers segmented in:</li>
              				<ul style="list-style: circle; margin:0">
							  <li>Loyalty? (how often do they return to Instacart)</li>
							  <li>Based on loyalty, are there differences in ordering habits (frequency and volume)?</li>
							  <li>Same as above, but based on demographics like age, family status, income, etc.?</li>
							  <li>Do different segments show different patterns in the types of products purchased?</li>	
              				</ul>
						</ul>
					</p>
				<h2>3. Process</h2>
					<p class="justified">
          			The data for this project had two sources:
					<ul>
          				<li>“The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017”, Accessed via <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/psparks/instacart-market-basket-analysis" target="_blank">Kaggle</a> on 30/06/2025</li>
          				<li>A fictional customers <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coach-courses-us/public/courses/data-immersion/A4/A4_Data_Assets/customers.zip" download>dataset</a> created in the scope of Career Foundry's Data Analytics course.</li>
          			</ul>
					</p>
					<p class="justified">
					Due to the nature and size of data, where the largest dataset had over 32M records, 
					Python was selected as the main tool for the project.
					Libraries like Pandas for all dataset handling, NumPy supporting some specific computational needs, 
					and MatPlotlib together with Seaborn to develop the visualizations during Exploratory Data Analysis 
					and later for final reporting, add to the technology package used.
					All of this being managed behind by Anaconda, as library manager for Python, and using Jupyter Notebook for script development.<br />
					By specific request of the client, a final report was prepared in Excel, based on its own template.

					<p class="justified">
					All the scripts developed during the project are available in the <a href="" target="_blank">Project's Github repository</a>
					</p>
					<p class="justified">
					Before the analysis, a careful preparation of the datasets was done taking care of all aspects of data cleaning, wrangling.
					TO BE CONTINUED! (need inspiration)
					Below there is an overview of the population flow and the merging process between the datasets.
					In the final stages, a random slicing was needed due to memory restrictions.
					This was done using a method called <code>seed()</code> that ensures reproducibilty of this random selection.

					<h2>4. Key Insights from Data</h2>
					<h3>Distribution of orders and revenue across the day/week</h3>



					
					<h3>Products sold and revenue across departments</h3>. 
					

					
					<h3>Loyalty</h3>
					<p>First off, why is loyalty key in retail business?</p>
					<p class="justified">
					Among many other benefits, if customers shop more frequently with Instacart they will:
					<ul style="margin:0">
						<li>most likely shop way less with the competition, ensuring better overall market share</li>
						<li>ensures a more steady and predictable stream of income</li>
					</ul>
					</p>




					
					<h3>Ordering Behaviours</h3>
					
					
 					<h2>5. Results</h2> 
					<h3>Recommendations derived from key insights to operation, sales and marketing</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Target/nudge 'regular' customers to increase loyalty base, and consequently number of orders</li>
							<li>Run surveys to understand what would engage 'regular/new' customers to order more (and eventually more frequently)</li>
							<li>Send reminders through various platforms (emails/push notifications)  after an order with the promos that customers could use next
								<ul style="list-style: circle; margin:0">
									<li>Ensure that these promos expire on a weekly basis, to engage customers in using them before expiry, i.e, shop weekly or sooner</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Adjust staff on weekends to ensure compliance and customer satisfaction in the delivery times</li>
							<li class="justified">Consider performing specific discounts on Tuesdays and Wednesdays (the less busy days), 
								especially directed for loyal and regular customers (the responsible for the largest amount of orders), 
								to try smooth out the demand across the week</li>	
						</ul>
